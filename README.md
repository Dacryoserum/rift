# rift

Navigate the depths of massive text files.

`rift` is a terminal UI viewer built for files that are too large for ordinary tools — logs, datasets, exports, anything from a few hundred megabytes to tens of gigabytes. It opens instantly via memory-mapped IO, starts navigation before the line index is complete, and provides features well beyond `less`.

## Features

**Navigation**
- Vim keybindings: `j/k`, `Ctrl+U/D`, `Ctrl+B/F`, `g/G`
- Jump anywhere: `:{n}` (line), `{n}%` (percentage), `:{n}b` (byte offset)
- Navigation history: `Ctrl+O` / `Ctrl+I` (jumplist, like vim)
- Split pane: `Ctrl+W` — two independent positions in the same file

**Search**
- `/` regex forward, `?` backward, `n/N` next/prev
- All matches highlighted simultaneously in the viewport
- `F` — fuzzy line search popup (fzf-style)
- Background search thread — stream results while navigating

**Visual**
- Minimap sidebar with braille density encoding — see the whole file structure at a glance
- Format-aware highlighting: log levels (ERROR/WARN/INFO), JSON Lines, CSV/TSV
- Three gutter modes: `l` absolute numbers, `L` relative, `~` line-length bar
- Line wrap toggle: `w`

**Bookmarks**
- `m{a-z}` — set a named bookmark, `'{a-z}` — jump to it
- `B` — bookmark manager (list, delete, jump)
- Bookmarks persist across sessions per file

**Analysis**
- `S` — statistics panel: line length histogram, character frequency, encoding, line ending style
- Encoding detection: UTF-8 / Latin-1 displayed in status bar

**Follow mode**
- `f` — tail the file live as it grows (like `tail -f`)

**Copy / Export**
- `y` — yank current line to clipboard
- `V` + motion + `Y` — yank a line range
- `:export {start},{end} {path}` — write a range of lines to a file

## Configuration

`~/.config/rift/config.toml`:

```toml
tab_size = 4
follow_poll_interval_ms = 250
minimap_enabled = true
theme = "Dark"   # "Dark" | "Light" | "Solarized"
```

## How it works

`rift` memory-maps the file — the OS handles paging, so the file is never fully loaded into RAM. A background thread builds a line offset index in two phases: a fast sampling pass (completes in ~0.5s for a 5GB file on NVMe), then a full sequential scan. Navigation works immediately using estimated positions from the sampling pass, and becomes exact as the full scan completes.

Search runs on a separate cancellable thread and streams results back to the UI. Bookmarks are persisted per-file using the file's inode + size + mtime as a key, so they survive renames as long as the content is unchanged.
